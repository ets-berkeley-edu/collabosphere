 * This script enables local verification of Caliper instrumentation. To use it, enable Caliper in your
 * local config and set the URL to a localhost address, e.g.:
 *
 * {
 *   "analytics": {
 *     "caliper": {
 *       "enabled": true,
 *       "url": "http://localhost:2525/events"
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Then start this script (`node scripts/caliper-listener.js`) in a separate terminal window. It will
 * pick up the URL from your config and log the body of any POST request received.
